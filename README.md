# CS-2-Project-3
This is my third Computer Science 2 class project. We were starting the multiple View Models and adding more windows that can appear during events. (button clicks)

This project was created to handle a List of Tasks and could sort based on priority or time to complete.
You could add task and/or subtask depending on the criteria added on the AddTaskWindow. 
Another Window was created to show the details of selected Task in the TaskList.
